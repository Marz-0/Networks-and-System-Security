**Institution:** Goldsmiths, University of London  

**Assessment:** E-Portfolio (30%)  

**Semester:** 2024/2025  



## Overview
This portfolio showcases my practical work across the Networks and Systems Security module. Each week includes:

- Completed lab tasks  
- Python scripts and outputs

### AI & LLM Security (Lab 9)

Lab 9 focuses on security in modern AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs):

    - Running and interacting with LLMs in LLM_model.py, gemma3.py, and qwen7b.py.
- Adversarial attack vectors against LLMs:
    - Prompt injection testing (Prompt_injection.py).
    - Model inversion (Model_inversion.py) – attempting to infer sensitive training data.
    - Model extraction (Model_extraction.py) – simulating attempts to clone a model’s functionality.
    - Data poisoning (Data_poinsoning.py) – exploring the impact of malicious data on model outputs.
- Documentation & reflection:
    - LLM_findings.md and Part_IV.md summarise the experiments, risks, and mitigations, linking them back to traditional security principles (CIA triad, access control, least privilege).

## Evidence of Technical Growth

This portfolio demonstrates:

- Progression from basic to advanced topics
Starting from simple key generation and socket programming, I moved into malware concepts, binary analysis, network recon, and eventually LLM security.
- Hands-on understanding of core security principles
    - Confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) in different contexts.
    - Authentication, authorisation, and accountability.
    - Secure configuration and defence-in-depth.
- Debugging & problem-solving

    - Handling socket timeouts and partial reads in Lab 2.
    - Fixing issues with large file handling and memory usage in binary analysis (Lab 6).
    - Interpreting unexpected scan results and WHOIS output in Lab 7.
    - Understanding surprising or unsafe LLM responses in Lab 9 and turning them into learning points.
- Professional documentation
    - Each lab includes structured summaries that:
        - Explain what I implemented.
        - Reflect on what went wrong and how I fixed it.
        - Connect the technical work to real-world security implications.



## Challenges & Solutions

### Socket Issues
Encrypted messages arrived partially; I fixed it by implementing buffered chunk reading.

### Binary Handling
Large file crashes led me to implement safer buffered reading techniques.

### Scan Timeouts
Investigating silent drops helped me understand firewall behaviour and TCP retransmissions.

### Wapiti Installation & PATH Issues

One of the main challenges in the week 5 lab was that Wapiti would not run on my system, even after installation. Windows could not recognise the wapiti command due to PATH and script-location conflicts. Instead of blocking my workflow, I adapted by: 
- Investigating where Wapiti installs its executables on Windows
- Updating my Python script to allow the use of full executable paths
- Adding clear error-handling to inform the user when the tool is not installed

This helped me understand how security tools interact with the OS environment and highlighted the importance of handling execution failures gracefully.



## Alignment with Assessment Criteria
This portfolio demonstrates:

- Clear, structured documentation  
- Correct and technically sound implementations  
- Analytical reflections  
- Professional presentation  


## Final Statement
This portfolio reflects my progression through applied cybersecurity tasks, growing from foundational experiments to more advanced cryptographic, network, and system-level security work. It demonstrates both technical skill and reflective understanding of core security principles.


# AI declaration


Throughout this module, AI was used for the following: 

Templating, structuring, debugging as well as explaining parts of the lab and lectures. This helped build my understanding of core security priciples during the completion and studying of the module, for the labs and lectures.
